        <h4>How I did it:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Installed Samba onto my Dell N7010 via Linux Mint Xfce terminal</li>
            <li>Created a shared directory so that my entire household can access the folder</li>
            <li>Configured samba by specifying the folder path, permissions, and setting <br> mask/directory mask</li>
            <li>Created a password and tied it to my already existing username in order to <br>limit access to the directory</li>
        </ol>
